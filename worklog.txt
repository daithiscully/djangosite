Notes Learned:
The code is the driving factor in the relationship with the database.
Make changes in the code and to have it relected in the database the the following:

1 -> python3 manage.py makemigrations music
      - This creates the required table structure in my database as specified in the music app

2 -> python3 manage.py migrate
      - Syncs up the database and the code


python3 manage.py sqlmigrate music 0001
 - Makes a migration file. If you run into errors with DB make sure it's synced with the code/apps
 - You must then run 'python3 manage.py migrate' again to migrate via the new migration file
